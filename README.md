## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get OmniCalc running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Replace `your-username/your-repository-name.git` with your actual repository URL.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables (for AI features):**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (you can copy `.env.example` if it exists, or create it from scratch). Add your Google AI API key:

    ```env
    # .env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
    ```

    You can obtain a Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Next.js development server.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **(Optional) Run Genkit developer UI (for testing AI flows separately):**
    If you want to test or debug Genkit flows directly, you can run the Genkit developer UI in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This usually starts on `http://localhost:4000`.
